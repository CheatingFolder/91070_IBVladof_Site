Now, 4 years later, local artists are painting up the buildings in hopes to rebuild the broken city. Justin Mespel reports on how the new street art impacts the city.</b><br><br>The once bustling city of Christchurch was forever changed by leaving a rubble of broken down buildings. Christchurch’s population dropped almost 10,000 people by February 2011, and what was once a lively city, was now left in quiet ruins. This city soon became the canvas for many local as well as famous street artists.<br><br>Local street artists work soon became common all around the city. From great big collaborations supported by the city council and benefactors, to simple unapproved stencils covered the buildings and ruins of what used to be central Christchurch. The street art however, did not go unnoticed and started to prompt the question is it beneficial to the city.<br><br>Some people still believe that any street art is illegal because it is often thought as a act of vandalism. Many are unaware that the artists may have permission, and are stuck in thinking the stereotype of illegal street art. However, the majority of the public's response to the street art has been positive, and the crowds show for it. The street art has had a positive visual appeal to locals and tourist amongst the ruins of Christchurch.<br><br>Ever since the street art has started in Christchurch, people have been going to see it. While it may have been just one or two people in the beginning, it definitely sparked an interest in people's eyes “attracting thousands of people” as staff reports. <br><br>Not long after, the RISE street art festival began and people crowded on the first weekend to see the exhibition. Stuff’s press quotes “ RISE hauled in almost 250,000 visitors and created a global splash.” There street art debut in 2014 was a definite success, and paved the way for their new art show called SPECTRUM in 2015.<br><br>The local artists also notice that their work is being admired.<br><br><b>“From what I've heard from the general public it's a positive thing for everybody and people are happy about it”.</b> <i>  - Jacob Yikes.</i><br><br>While stating that he didn't necessarily do it for the public's admiration or benefit, but it's definitely nice to see that they appreciate it. The public definitely accepted the street art in Christchurch, and saw it as a positive thing in contributing to the regrowth of the city.<br><br>The view on street art has definitely changed in Christchurch in the past few years. Before the earthquake, only a select few of people were be allowed to paint in the city at all. A crew called “project legit” were one of the few allowed to paint, but it was on a much smaller scale usually only doing a few small things like plant boxes and smaller walls.<br><br>Since then, the city has definitely opened up more. This change allowed the artists to feel more comfortable while painting in the city. However not all of the artist’s feel like the change is a good thing.<br><br><b>“The leniency on street art and graffiti had definitely sort of widen, and I’m still coming to terms with it”.</b><i> - Jacob Yikes</i><br><br>Graffiti and street art has a culture of its own.  While Jacob said that it is started to change because the city is accepting it, doesn't mean that the artist are. Some artists strongly feel that defying the law is part of street arts culture. Artists say that their art is not necessarily meant to be for the city, but more as them taking a stand. The street art in Christchurch definitely changed the game when it came to the law and street art and not everyone was ready to accept it.<br><br>Artists know that their work won’t last forever, and will slowly fade away as Christchurch is broken down and rebuilt.<br><br><b>“Were kind of just filling in spaces. Everything we do isn't permanent, it's always going to be a temporary thing. Things are gonna get built in front of it. It will get destroyed or it will get painted over it's just the nature of it. But i think we're definitely doing something a little bit more positive now and it's being able to sort of stay around.”</b><i> - Jacob Yikes</i><br><br>Although the street art may not be around for a long time, it definitely plays an important part in bringing people back into the city. As people return to visit the city, the shops in will begin to have more business, and hopefully the city will once again begin to thrive.<br><br><br>
